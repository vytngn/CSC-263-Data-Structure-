Suppose that a list contains Comparable objects. Implement a method that returns 
a new list of items that are less than some given item.  The header of the method 
could be as follows:
public  LList<T>  getAllLessThan( Comparable<T>  anObject)
Write an implementation of this method for the class LList. Make sure that your 
method does not affect the state of the original list.
