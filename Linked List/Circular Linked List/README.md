Note on Circular Linked List: <br/>
- last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list.
- Has no beginning or end
- No null value is present in the next part of any of the nodes.
- Insertion and deletion at both ends â‡’ O(1) constant time.
We use Circular Linked list when:
- frequent access to the first and last element is required 
- Because circular linked list allows easy access to both the first and last node. Why ?
    - ***Having reference to the last node.***
