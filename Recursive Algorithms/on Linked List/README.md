Using recursive: <br/> 
- prints a linked list in a forward direction: printList.java
- prints a linked list in a reverse order: printReverseList.java
- prints the length of the linked list: getLength.java
- compute the sum of all the values in the nodes of a linked list: getSum.java
- performs a linear search and returns either null or a reference to the node containing value: linearSearch.java
- double each link.value until a link.value ==0 is reach, or there are no more links: lookOut.java
